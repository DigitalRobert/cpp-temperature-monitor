# cpp-temperature-monitor
Simulation of Industrial Temperature Monitoring.

Small C++ project simulating a simple temperature measurement device.

The goal is not to build a final application but to gradually design a small controller-like program and practice core C++ meachanism.

Planned elements:
- sensor readings 
- periodic measurements
- logging to file
- simple alarm states

Next session:
- Make reading count configurable
- Add interval setting
- Add timestamp logging

Project grows step by step.
